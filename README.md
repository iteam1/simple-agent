Hugging Face allow us to build agents or tools by framework called `smolagents`. `smolagents` have some built-in Classes , methods and tools to help us build agents, like `DuckDuckGoSearch` or `Markdownify`. We can also enherit tools from the other. Hugging Face allow as to serve agents on spaces or we can run them locally.
